#PYTHON CRASH COURSE by Eric Eric Matthes


The goal of this book is to bring you up to speed with Python as quickly as
possible so you can build programs that work—games, data visualizations,
and web applications—while developing a foundation in programming that
will serve you well for the rest of your life. Python Crash Course is written for
people of any age who have never programmed in Python before or have
never programmed at all. If you want to learn the basics of programming
quickly so you can focus on interesting projects, and you like to test your
understanding of new concepts by solving meaningful problems, this book
is for you. Python Crash Course is also perfect for middle school and high
school teachers who want to offer their students a project-based introduction to programming

#What Can You Expect to Learn?
The purpose of this book is to make you a good programmer in general
and a good Python programmer in particular. You’ll learn efficiently and
adopt good habits as I provide you with a solid foundation in general programming concepts. After working your way through Python Crash Course,
you should be ready to move on to more advanced Python techniques, and
your next programming language will be even easier to grasp.
